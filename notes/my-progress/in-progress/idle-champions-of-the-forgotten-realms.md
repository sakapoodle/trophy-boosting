Idle Champions
===============

priorities:
	- swap main DPS from Delina to Krond, Hitch or Asharra (best-geared champ)
		try each of them out, see which one can carry furthest
	- open timegate manually when there's no event going on
	- unlock Deekin from the Package deals?
	- global T1 global blessings
?	- gain more favor (Torm) for better event favor conversion rate
	- get Liars Night items/achievements
		make sure all tokens are used up before event ends
	- unlock Drizzt
	- unlock Torm T2 blessing Gem Hunter
	- unlock Azaka
