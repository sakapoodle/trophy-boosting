## Dead by Daylight

#### "Where did they go!?" trophy - boosting method:  

1. **Find 3 other players** that want to get this trophy.  
2. Set up **voicechat**, this will improve communication.  
3. Invite the other players to a **survivor lobby**.  
4. Make sure there are at least **a few skeleton or dull keys** (3 or more. that can be used if you need multiple attempts, the more the better.  
5. Decide before hitting "Ready" **who equips the key** for the next game.  
6. Have **someone else equip a map** with the "black lock" (hatch. add-on, this is optional but recommended.  
7. Whoever equips the key should also **use an add-on called Weaved Ring or an offering called White Ward**, just as an insurance if the key gets lost, it won't disappear from inventory.  
8. Hit "Ready" and **enter the killer lobby**.  
9. **Message the killer** like this:  
    (_hold PS button > go to Dead by Daylight > go to "Currently Playing with" > Send message_), and ask if they can help you with the trophy, 20% chance they will from my experience.  
10.
    1. **If they decide to help**, then you're in luck, skip to step 11.  
    2. If they **don't decide to help**, **just try to survive**. The player that has the key should survive, if he/she dies then someone else **PICK UP the key** and **survive with it** to **KEEP IT**! You might still be able to get the trophy legit, even if the killer is trying to kill everyone.  
11. **Repair all 5 generators**.  
12. The hatch appears **after the 5 generators** are repaired, **look for it**. The player with the map can locate it by using their item.  
13. **(VERY IMPORTANT!)** When you find the hatch, **DON'T enter or open it**, as it can only be **open for 30 seconds** with the key, first make sure everyone is grouped up!
14. Now when everyone is grouped up, the player with the key **opens it and everyone jumps in, in quick succession**. Congrats, you should have the trophy! :)
