#### One Life - trials

**winning team**:
- Kill with brainer/melee
- Win fast (within 1 min)
- Have the last enemy break your jammer and win
- All your allies should be alive, or only 1 left standing
- Win 3-0

**losing team**:
- Stay together, don't spread out, it's easier to find your team this way
- If you're the last one alive, break enemy jammers and let them kill you
