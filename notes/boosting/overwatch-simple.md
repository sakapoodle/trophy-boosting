## Overwatch

_These notes are the "simplified" version of the full [Overwatch boosting notes](./overwatch.md),  
refer to the full notes for all the details._

#### Matchmaking method:  

- Set up lobby with **only 4 boosting players**  
  (even if there are more boosting players ready to join)
- Search for a game in **Quickplay** mode.
- Everyone in the lobby, hover over "Leave Group" by pressing <span>Triangle (&#9651;) then Cross (X)</span>.
- **(IMPORTANT!)** As soon as _"Game Found"_ appears at the top of your screen, **LEAVE GROUP!**  
  This will cause the team to _"ungroup"_ and we will **end up on opposite teams**!
- Once we're in game on opposing teams, the **rest of the boosting players join in** by going to the main menu: Social > Join Game  
  (**IMPORTANT!** Make sure they choose "Join **Game**" and NOT "Join Group" in order to stay _"ungrouped"_)
- Now the remaining boosters will have to **wait as spectators before randoms leave**, then they will join the game.  
  Only **max 4 players can spectate**, so if there are 5 players or more trying to "Join Game" they will be **stuck in the matchmaking queue** until more spectator spots are available. Don't worry about this, just wait.

#### Boosting session rules:  

- **#1 In-game**: Don't get AFK kicked - use your abilities, deal damage and take damage.
- **#2 Communication**: Get on voice chat - It's ok to join without mic/muted, **just make sure you hear us (the host).**  
  Text chat responses on Discord may be delayed, no communication will be done over PSN message groups during the session.  
- **#3 Communication**: Keep the voice channel clear - **Mute your mic if it's not your turn**, so that it doesn't get noisy.
- **#4 Respect the order list**: Everyone gets to **do 2 trophies per turn** then we move to the next player. Players are also free to _"sneak in easier trophies"_ by their own accord, but **only if it doesn't disrupt** the primary objective. (ie. you can't just sneak in disruptively eg. kill 4 players with junkrat, reaper etc. when someone else is setting up 4-player kills, but you can do some non-disruptive trophies for eg. Sombra, Tracer, Roadhog etc.)  
It's recommended that you try to _"synergize your own trophy targets with other players"_, eg. when someone on your team is going for "Orisa - Halt State", try D.Va or Reaper ult 4-kill trophies, and vice versa. Someone on your team going for any 4-kill ult trophy? Try "Ana - Enabler". etc.  
- **#5 Player order list**: Go by alphabetical order of the members in voicechat. It's easier to manage for the host. The host decides if players joining mid-session (that have been waiting) are given priority or if they have to wait their turn. We will always try to **reward those who have been waiting for their turn** and contributed by participating and patiently waiting for their turn.  
- **#6 Be co-operative**: Be **patient, co-operative, focused, efficient and communicative** so you get to your turn faster:
  - **Wait for your turn** - We go by a set order, **wait until the host tells you it's your turn**.  
  - **Co-operate** - The better you are at co-operating, the **faster we will get to your turn**!
  - **(IMPORTANT!) Change to the correct hero & team comp** - Try to understand the trophy setups beforehand, if you're unexperienced then don't worry as usually the host will tell you how to set up.  
      - **Change to the appropriate hero depending on the set up!**  
      This is where **most boosters fail** and where it **takes longer to get trophies**!  
      When we need you to switch to tank, then **DO IT!**  
      When we need you to switch to a damage dealer, **DO IT!**  
      - Don't cling on to your hero for your next trophy, you will get it when it's your turn. Follow the hosts instructions and directives to speed up the process!  
  - **Pick your target trophy** - When it's your turn, **tell the host clearly what you want to do**.
      - You should already know beforehand what you want to do
      - **TIP**: Write down a list before the session of what trophies you want to earn (start with the hardest)  
      - When you're done getting it, **confirm clearly** that you got it so we can move on.  
- **#7 Don't be annoying**:  
  - **Don't whine and bitch - we don't care** about you being unlucky and that you got here late and now you have to wait for a full player rotation before your turn.  
  - **We don't care** that you _"just need this trophy really fast"_ or that you _"only have this one trophy left then you're done"_, don't bring it up.  
  - Wait for your turn, like everyone else, and follow instructions.
  - You will get what you need in due time. Sit down and play nice. Otherwise your position will be replaced by someone else that is more co-operative and you won't be invited to future boosting sessions.
  - **Don't ask whose turn it is every 10 seconds..** - The host probably knows and is too busy answering every little question. Check the chat, it should be announced there, if not listen to the host.  
  - Don't put **extra burden on the host/organizers**, look up stuff by yourself and be helpful instead. Try to take some workload off the organizers and help out, lessen the burden.
- **#8 Player participation (IMPORTANT!)**: Keep backfilling - "Join Game" (not "Join Group") to make sure we have boosters joining the match room when random players leave, or when other boosters leave their spot. A maximum of 4 boosters can join as spectators, the rest will be in the matchmaking queue _"searching for game.."_.  
It is **VERY IMPORTANT** that **if you decide to leave, please make sure there are enough players waiting to join** so that we don't get backfilled with a random player that might disrupt the whole session!  
So **never just leave suddenly**, check with the host if it's ok and that we have someone else willing to boost and fill your spot!
