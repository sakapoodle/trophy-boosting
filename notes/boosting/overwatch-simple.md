## Overwatch

_These notes are the "simplified" version of the full [Overwatch boosting notes](./overwatch.md),  
refer to the full notes for all the details._

#### Matchmaking method:  

- Set up lobby with **only 4 boosting players**  
  (even if there are more boosting players ready to join)  
  Usually the 4 "starting players" are the host and 3 players with mics.
- Search for a game in **Quickplay** mode.
- Everyone in the lobby, hover over "Leave Group" by pressing <span>Triangle (&#9651;) then Cross (X)</span>.
- **(IMPORTANT!)** As soon as _"Game Found"_ appears at the top of your screen, **LEAVE GROUP!**  
- Once we're in game on opposing teams, the **rest of the boosting players join in** by going to the main menu: Social > Join Game  
  (**IMPORTANT!** Make sure they choose "Join **Game**" and NOT "Join Group" in order to stay _"ungrouped"_)
- Now the remaining boosters will have to **wait as spectators before randoms leave**, then they will join the game.  
  Only **max 4 players can spectate**, so if there're 5 players or more trying to "Join Game" they will be **stuck in the matchmaking queue** until more spectator spots are available.

#### Preparing for the boosting session:

- **Send or accept friend requests** from other players on PSN before the session, do this only for the "starting players", don't need everybody on your friendlist.
- **Change your [Discord server nickname](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames) to your PSN ID** for easier identification. You may switch back to your preferred nickname on Discord when the session is over.
- **Join the Discord voicechat**, we need to have a headcount of how many showed up and will participate in the boosting session.

#### Boosting session rules:  

- **#1 In-game**: Don't get AFK kicked - Use your abilities, deal damage and take damage.
- **#2 Communication**: Get on voice chat - It's ok to join without mic/muted, **just make sure you hear us (the host).**  
  Voicechat is our primary means of communication, text chat communication will be delayed or unused while we boost.
- **#3 Communication**: Keep the voice channel clear - **Mute your mic if it's not your turn** and there's background noise.
- **#4 Respect the order list**: Everyone gets to **do 2 trophies per turn** then we move to the next player.
    - Players are also free to _"sneak in easier trophies"_ by their own accord, but **only if it doesn't disrupt** the primary objective.
    - It's recommended that you try to _"synergize your own trophy targets"_ with other players.
- **#5 Player order list**: Go by alphabetical order of the members in voicechat.
    - The host decides if players joining mid-session (that have been waiting) are given priority or if they have to wait for their turn.
    - We will always try to **reward those who have been waiting for their turn** and contributed by showing up and waiting patiently.
- **#6 Be co-operative**: Be **patient, co-operative, focused, efficient and communicative** so you get to your turn faster:
    - **Wait for your turn** - We go by a set order, **wait until the host tells you it's your turn**.
    - **Co-operate** - The better you are at co-operating, the **faster we will get to your turn**!
- **#7 (IMPORTANT!) Change to the correct hero & team comp** - Try to understand the trophy setups beforehand
    - This is where **most boosters fail** and where it **takes longer to get trophies**!
    - When we need you to switch to tank, then **DO IT!**  
      When we need you to switch to a damage dealer, **DO IT!**  
    - Don't cling on to your hero for your next trophy, you will get it when it's your turn.
- **#8 Pick your target trophy** - When it's your turn, **tell the host clearly what trophy you want**.
    - You should already know beforehand what you want to do
    - **TIP**: Write down a list before the session of what trophies you want to earn (start with the hardest)
    - When you're done getting your trophy, **confirm clearly** that you got it so we can move on
- **#9 Don't be annoying**:
  - **Don't whine and bitch - we don't care** about you being unlucky and that you got here late or whatever reason or excuse you have.
  - **We don't care** that you _"just need this trophy really fast"_ or that you _"only have this one trophy left then you're done"_, don't bring it up.
  - Wait for your turn, like everyone else, and follow instructions.
  - You will get what you need in due time. Sit down and play nice. Otherwise your position will be replaced by someone else that is more co-operative and you won't be invited to future boosting sessions.
  - **Don't ask whose turn it is every 10 seconds..** - The host probably knows and is too busy answering every little question. Check the chat, it should be announced there, if not listen to the host.
  - Don't put **extra burden on the host/organizers**, look up stuff by yourself and be helpful instead. Try to take some workload off the organizers and help out, lessen the burden.
- **#10 Player participation (IMPORTANT!)**: Keep backfilling - "Join Game" (not "Join Group") to make sure we have boosters joining the match room when random players leave, or when other boosters leave their spot.
    - A maximum of 4 boosters can join as spectators, the rest will be in the matchmaking queue _"searching for game.."_.  
    - This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: **If you decide to leave, please make sure there are enough players waiting to join** so that we don't get backfilled with a random player that might disrupt the whole session!
    - So **never just leave suddenly**, check with the host if it's ok and that we have someone else willing to boost and fill your spot before you leave!
