## Overwatch

#### Matchmaking method:  
This section describes how to **set up boosting partners on opposite teams**,  
eg. 4 boosting players to form a 2v2 setup in a match.

- Set up a pre-game lobby of **3-4 boosting players** (even if there are more boosting partners ready to join)
- Search for a game in **Quickplay** mode.
- Everyone in the lobby, hover over "Leave Game" by pressing <span>Triangle (&#9651;) then Cross (X)</span>.
- **(IMPORTANT!)** As soon as _"Game Found"_ appears at the top of your screen, **LEAVE GAME!**  
  This will cause the 3-4 player team to _"ungroup"_ and with any luck, you will **end up on opposite teams with your boosting partners**!
- Once you're set up on opposing teams, the **rest of the boosting players fill in** by going to the main menu: Social > Join Game (**IMPORTANT!** Make sure they choose "Join Game" and NOT "Join Group" in order to stay _"ungrouped"_)
- They will have to **wait as spectators before randoms leave**, then they will join the game.  
  Note that only **max 4 players can spectate**, so if there are 5 players or more trying to "Join Game" they will be **stuck in the matchmaking queue** until more spectator spots are available.


#### Boosting session rules:  
This section details **ground rules for boosting sessions** that will ensure it's a smooth and pleasant experience,  
even when you're in a team of 6v6 (12 players) and everyone is out for themselves and their own trophies.  
The most important thing here is to **keep it civil and orderly**, make sure that everyone gets a chance to get their trophy, that none is skipped in turn or ignored.

- **#1 In-game**: Don't get AFK kicked - move around and make sure you deal damage and use abilities at least once every 2 minutes.  
- **#2 Communication**: Get on voice chat - It's ok to join without mic/muted, **just make sure you hear us (the host).** Text chat responses may be delayed, and no communication will be done over PSN message groups during the session.  
- **#3 Communication**: Keep the voice channel clear - **Mute your mic if it's not your turn**, so that it doesn't get noisy. Also if a mod is present they can at their own discretion server mute you.  
- **#4 Respect the order list**: Everyone gets to **do 1 trophy per turn** then we move to the next player. Players are also free to _"sneak in easier trophies"_ by their own accord, but only if it doesn't disrupt the primary objective. (ie. you can't just sneak in disruptively eg. kill 4 players with junkrat, reaper etc. when someone else is setting up but you can do some non-disruptive trophies for eg. Sombra, Tracer, Roadhog etc.)  
It's recommended that you try to _"synergize your own trophy targets with other players"_, eg. when someone on your team is going for "Orisa - Halt State", try D.VA or Reaper ult 4-kill trophies, and vice versa. Someone on your team going for any 4-kill ult trophy? Try "Ana - Enabler". etc.  
- **#5 Player order list**: Go by alphabetical order of the members in voicechat. It's easier to manage for the hosts. The host decides if players joining mid-session but have been waiting are given priority or if they have to wait their turn. We will always try to reward those that have waited for their turn and contributed by participating and patiently waiting for their turn.  
- **#6 Be co-operative**: We all understand everyone is here for their own trophies, but the best way to achieve this is to be **patient, co-operative, focused, efficient and communicative** so you get to your turn faster:
  - **Wait for your turn** - We go by a set order (usually by the participants in voicechat channel from top to bottom of the list), **wait until the host tells you it's your turn**.  
  - **Co-operate** - The better you are at co-operating, the faster and more smoothly everything will go, I can promise you that (**you will get your turn faster!**).
  - **(IMPORTANT!) Change to the correct hero & team comp** - It is preferred if **everyone understands the trophy setups**, but don't worry as usually the host will tell you how to set up.  
  **Change to the appropriate hero depending on the set up!** This is where **most boosters fail** and where it **takes longer to get trophies**!  
  When you're told to switch to a tank, **JUST DO IT!** When you're told to switch to a damage dealer, **JUST DO IT**  
  Don't cling on to your hero for your next trophy, you will get it when it's your turn. Follow the hosts commands to speed up the process!  
  - **Pick your target trophy** - When it's your turn, **tell the host clearly what you want to do**, you should already know beforehand what you want to do (write down a list before the session).  
  When you're done getting it, **confirm clearly** that you got it so we can move on.  
- **#7 Don't be annoying**:  
  - **Don't whine and bitch - we don't care** about you being unlucky and that you got here late and now you have to wait for a full player rotation before your turn.  
  **We don't care** that you _"just need this trophy really fast"_ or that you _"only have this one trophy left then you're done"_, don't bring it up.  
  Wait for your turn, like everyone else, and follow instructions. You will get what you need in due time. Sit down and play nice. Otherwise your position will be replaced by someone else that is more co-operative and you won't be invited to future boosting sessions.
  - **Don't ask whose turn it is every 10 seconds..** - The host probably knows and is too busy answering every little question. Check the chat, it should be announced there, if not listen to the host.  
  Don't put extra burden on the host/organizers, look up stuff by yourself and be helpful instead. Try to take some workload off the organizers and help out, lessen the burden.
- **#8 Player participation (IMPORTANT!)**: Keep backfilling - "Join Game" (not "Join Group") to make sure we have boosters joining the match room when random players leave, or when other boosters leave their spot. A maximum of 4 boosters can join as spectators, the rest will be in the matchmaking queue _"searching for game.."_.  
It is **VERY IMPORTANT** that **if you decide to leave, please make sure there are enough players waiting to join** so that we don't get backfilled with a random player that might disrupt (troll) the whole session!  
So **never just leave suddenly**, check with the host if it's ok and that we have someone else willing to boost and fill your spot!
