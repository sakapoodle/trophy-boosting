Batman: Arkham Origins - XP boosting method:

- Joker elite: take turns with Bane stepping in and out of a capture zone, Joker captures it fully.
- Bane elite: take turns with Joker stepping in and out of a capture zone, use the dart item on the hero(es) (Batman & Robin) and Joker when it's off cooldown.
- Heroes: keep placing scrambler, and help Bane get more XP occassionally.
