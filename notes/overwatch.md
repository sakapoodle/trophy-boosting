### Overwatch

**Matchmaking method**:  
This section describes how to **set up boosting partners on opposite teams**,  
eg. 4 boosting players to form a 2v2 setup in a match.

- Set up a pre-game lobby of **3-4 boosting players** (even if there are more boosting partners ready to join)
- Search for a game in **Quickplay** mode.
- Everyone in the lobby, hover over "Leave Game" by pressing <span>Triangle (&#9651;) then Cross (X)</span>.
- **(IMPORTANT!)** As soon as _"Game Found"_ appears at the top of your screen, **LEAVE GAME!** With any luck, you will end up on opposite teams with your boosting partners.
- Once you're set up on opposing team, the rest of the boosting players fill in by going to: Social > Join game (NOT team)
- They will have to wait as spectators before randoms leave, then they will join the game. Also max 4 people or so can spectate, so if there's more than 4 ppl trying to join in they'll be stuck in the matchmaking queue until the boosting players waiting as spectators join the game.

**Boosting session rules**:
**#1 In-game**: Don't get AFK kicked - move around and make sure you deal damage and use abilities at least once every 2 minutes.
**#2 Communication**: Get on voice chat - It's ok to join without mic/muted, **just make sure you hear us (the host).** Text chat responses may be delayed, and no communication will be done over PSN message groups during the session.
**#3 Communication**: Keep the voice channel clear - **Mute your mic if it's not your turn**, so that it doesn't get noisy. Also if a mod is present they can at their own discretion server mute you.
**#4 Respect the order list**: Everyone gets to **do 1 trophy per turn** then we move to the next player. Players are also free to __sneak in easier trophies__â€‹ by their own accord, but only if it doesn't disrupt the primary objective. (ie. you can't just sneak in disruptively eg. kill 4 players with junkrat, reaper etc. when someone else is setting up but you can do some non-disruptive trophies for eg. Sombra, Tracer, Roadhog etc.) It's recommended that you __try synergize your own trophy targets with other players__, eg. someone on your team going for "Orisa - Halt State"? Try D.VA or Reaper ult 4-kill trophies, and vice versa. Someone on your team going for any 4-kill ult trophy? Try "Ana - Enabler". etc etc.
**#5 Player order list**: Go by alphabetical order of the members in voicechat. It's easier to manage for the hosts. The host decides if players joining mid-session but have been waiting are given priority or if they have to wait their turn. We will always try to reward those that have waited for long but not gotten anything.
**#6 Be co-operative**: We all understand everyone is here for their own trophies, but the best way to achieve this is to **be patient, co-operative, focused, efficient and communicative** so you get to your turn faster:
--- 1. Wait for your turn - We go by a set order (usually by the participants in voicechat channel from top to bottom of the list), **wait until the host tells you it's your turn**.
--- 2. Co-operate - The better you co-op the faster and more smoothly everything will go. It is preferred if **everyone understands the setups**, but don't worry as usually the host will tell you how to set up. __**VERY IMPORTANT**__: **Change to the appropriate hero depending on the set up.** This is where most boosters fail and where it takes longer to get trophies. When you're told to switch to a tank, **do it!** When you're told to switch to a damage dealer, **do it!** Don't cling on to your hero for your next trophy, you will get it when it's your turn.
--- 3. Pick your target trophy - When it's your turn, **tell the host clearly what you want to do**, you should already know beforehand what you want to do (write down a list before the session). When you're done getting it, **confirm clearly** that you got it so we can move on.
**#7 Don't be annoying**: 
--- 1. **Don't whine or bring your personal BS** - **We don't care** about you being unlucky, or that this or that didn't work out for you. **We don't care** that you "just need this trophy really fast" or that you "only have this one trophy left then you're done", don't bring it up. Be a good girl/boy and wait for your turn, and follow instructions and you will get what you need in due time. Sit down and play nice.
--- 2. **Don't ask whose turn it is every 10 seconds..** - Check the chat, it should be announced there, if not listen to the host, he/she should be very clear with whose turn it is. Don't put extra burden on the host/organizers, look up stuff by yourself and be useful, not a burden to the whole group!
**#8 Player participation**: Keep backfilling - "Join game" (not "Join group") to make sure we have boosters joining the match room when random players leave, or when other boosters leave their spot. A maximum of 4 boosters can join as spectators, the rest will be "searching for game..". It is very __IMPORTANT__ that **if you decide to leave, please make sure there are enough players waiting to join** so that we don't get backfilled with a random player that may disrupt the whole session!
